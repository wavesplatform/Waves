# Waves [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wavesplatform/Waves.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wavesplatform/Waves)

Waves is an open source [blockchain platform](https://wavesplatform.com/).

You can use it to build your own decentralised applications. Waves provides full blockchain ecosystem including smart contracts language called RIDE.

## How does the blockchain network work?

There is a huge collection of nodes deployed by miners that store all of the network information in the chain of blocks (blockchain), process requests and can add new transactions to the network after checking their compliance with the rules. The miners are rewarded with the network coins called MRT. 

The main advantage of this technology is that each node is a synchronized copy of the main blockchain: it means that the information is stored decentralized and won't be overwritten globally if one of the users changes it at one of the node storages. This can guarantee that the user's information will stay fair and unchangeable. 



## What is node?

A **node** is a [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)) connected to the [blockchain network](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/blockchain/blockchain-network.html) using the [Waves Node](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves) application.

Node functions are:

- [blocks](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/blockchain/block.html) storage
- [transaction validation](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-validation.html)
- sending [transactions](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/blockchain/transaction.html)

## Build from Source

The waves-node can be built and installed wherever java can run. For ***Ubuntu***, sbt packageAllproduces only deb package but for other operating systems, ZIP archive or a fat JAR can be used as well. To build and test your Waves Node, you will need to follow these steps:



### Prerequisites

You'll need Java (JRE & JDK) and SBT (Scala Build Tools) on your machine. Docker is needed for testing.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre default-jdk
```

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your operating system ([Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html), [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html), [Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)).

https://www.docker.com

### Build

```
git clone https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves.git
cd Waves
sbt checkPR  # builds and runs unit tests
```

### Integration Tests (optional)

Create a Docker image before you run any test: 

```sh
sbt node-it/docker
SBT_THREAD_NUMBER=4 sbt node-it/test  # adjest thread-number as needed

#run one test
sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName  # or
sbt node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName
```


### Packaging

```sh
sbt packageAll                    # for mainnet use
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll  # for testnet use
```

### Installing DEB package

DEB package located in target folder. You can replace '*' with actual package name:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```

### Running fat jar

You can replace waves-all*.jar with actual jar name (it should have "all"-word):

```
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/file
```

**Note.** For OSX - homebrew is preferable choice. You can install java with brew cask install java and sbt with brew install sbt@1. Build/Test steps are common for any OS (but you should use ‘' instead of '/' in windows). 



### 8. Running an extension project locally during development

#### SBT

```sh
sbt "extension-module/run /path/to/configuration"

```

#### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Click on `Add configuration` (or `Edit configurations...`)
2. Click on `+` to add a new configuration, choose `Application`
3. Specify:
   - Main class: `com.wavesplatform.Application`
   - Program arguments: `/path/to/configuration`
   - Use classpath of module: `extension-module`
4. Click on `OK`
5. Run this configuration



> There is another way to run a Waves Node: using **Waves Docker container**. Learn more about it in the [docs](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/waves-node/waves-node-in-docker.html).
